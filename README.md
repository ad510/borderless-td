In this tower defense-like game, there are bears roaming around an infinitely large forest. You can build wood cutters to collect wood and build towers to tame the bears, and the goal is to survive as long as you can. I wrote the game using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL so you can play it online at the link above. I made this for a computer science class in fall 2012.
