      <div class="content">You're in an infinitely large forest with untamed bears. Click on the map to move around. Click the axe icon in the bottom left corner to build a wood cutter (to collect wood), and click the tower icon in the bottom left corner to build a tower (to shoot love at bears and make them go poof). Tame the bears for as long as you can! If your character dies, the closest wood cutter is turned into your character. The game ends when there are no wood cutters left to turn into you.</div>
