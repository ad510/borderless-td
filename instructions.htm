      <div class="content"><b>TODO: UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS</b>; There is an infinitely large map with randomly placed trees. The player can move around and place wood-cutting machines on the trees, which collect wood and automatically jump to the next tree after they have collected all of the wood from that tree. (They cost wood to make.) Throughout the infinite map there are monsters roaming around, each with a preferred random direction (likely up, down, left, and right only). They attack the player or anything the player builds if they run into them. Therefore, the player can place arrow towers (which cost wood) which shoot at the monsters. If the player loses all of his/her health, a randomly chosen wood cutter or arrow tower is turned into the player. The spawn rate of the monsters gradually increases over time. If the player runs out of health and there are no more wood cutters or arrow towers left, the game ends.</div>
