      <div class="content">There is an infinitely large map with randomly placed trees. Click on the map to move around. Click the axe icon in the bottom left corner to build a wood cutter (to collect wood), and click the tower icon in the bottom left corner to build a tower (to shoot at monsters). Survive the monsters as long as you can! If your character dies, the closest wood cutter is turned into your character. The game ends when there are no wood cutters left to turn into you.</div>
